pip install python-dotenv

npm install --global yarn (for installing ganache cli)

yarn global add ganache-cli  #this did not work

npm install -g ganache-cli

to start your blockchain in cmd, run
ganache-cli --deterministic   #so that private keys are always same


We can run a ethereum test net node. But this is not always practical. So we use a third pary service that will run a node for us

https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
installing brownie
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install eth-brownie

after installing brownie, 
brownie --version

Prior to installing brownie creation of a virtual environment is required.
However we could install brownie with pipx with out a virtual environment

python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install eth-brownie

This did not work in our case,
so we downloaded a portable version of python 3.8 from sourceforge.net, ran an envsetup.bat to add the python path and pip path to our %path%
and created a virtual environment with python 3.8
1.pip install pipenv , inside our new python 3.8
2. Then inside our project folder, ran envsetup.bat and pipenv --python 3.8
3. pipenv shell
4. inside here reinstall all packages and eth-brownie with 'pip install'
