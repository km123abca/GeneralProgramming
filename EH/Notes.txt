Regular Expressions

*. re.match tries to match the entire sentence and returns false if any unmatched pattern is found
                                                           true as soon as a match is obtained
    print(re.match('[a-z]+','hello people')) returns hello , but
    print(re.match('[a-z]+','3hello people'))  returns false
    This is unlike re.search
